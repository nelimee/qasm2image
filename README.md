# qasm2image

The qasm2image repository provides functions to represent quantum circuits written following the [OpenQASM](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-openqasm) specification.

## Not supported operations (TODO)

### Classically controlled operations

#### Description

The operations controlled by classical bits are not correctly drawn.

#### Example

See test-case [`inverseqft1.qasm`](tests/qasm/inverseqft1.qasm)

## Installation

### Dependencies

All the dependencies are available via the PIP tool. See the installation instructions below.

### Installation procedure

```shell
# Cloning the git repository
git clone https://github.com/nelimeee/qasm2image.git
# Installing the dependencies locally
pip3 install --user -r qasm2image/dependencies.txt
```

You may also need to edit your Python path in order to be able to import the qasm2image module.

## Usage

### In a Python environnement

```python
# Import the functions
from qasm2svg import qasm2svg
from qasm2png import qasm2png
# Generate your QASM string (either read from a file or generate a circuit and ask for its QASM).
qasm_str = "..."
# Define the basis used to represent the circuit
basis = 'u1,u2,u3,U,cx'
# Compute the SVG representation
svg_str = qasm2svg(qasm_str, basis=basis, show_clbits=True)
# Compute the PNG representation
png_bytes = qasm2png(qasm_str, basis=basis, show_clbits=True)
# Types of the outputs
assert type(svg_str) is str
assert type(png_bytes) is bytes
# Write the result into files
with open('circuit.svg', 'w') as svg_file:
    svg_file.write(svg_str)
# Don't forget to write in *binary* mode for PNG
with open('circuit.png', 'wb') as png_file:
    png_file.write(png_bytes)
```

### In a shell environnement

A wrapper can be found in the `tools/` directory. This wrapper can be used as follow:

```shell
$ ./qasm2image.py -h
usage: qasm2image.py [-h] [-b BASIS] [--hide-clbits] [-s SCALE]
                     input_file output_file

Transform a quantum circuit in QASM format to an image format.

positional arguments:
  input_file            the QASM file implementing the circuit to transform
  output_file           the image file that will be generated by the tool

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b BASIS, --basis BASIS
                        a comma-separated list of gate names which represent
                        the gate basis in which the circuit will be decomposed
  --hide-clbits         if present, classical bits will not be represented
  -s SCALE, --scale SCALE
                        scale of the PNG image. SVG output is not affected by
                        this parameter
```
